# apollo

## About
This is a vue 3 project based on the tutorial by Natalia Tepluhina that was featured on Jason Lengstorf's learn with Jason: https://www.learnwithjason.dev/build-apps-with-vue-3-apollo-client-3
(they used vue-apollo version 4 although it says version 3 in the title) 

I modified their code to use FaunaDB (https://faunadb.com) and the site is hosted on netlify, wh

It is merged with elements from the fauna graphql and fql tutorials,
